https://travisguillory.github.io/TxAServerQuery/

This page is used to check the Texas Arlington Counter-Strike Source server to query the current game info. and current players. The site also qqueries sister servers. Thank you to Old and Slow for providing server access since 2002.

## Adaptive Bots (Man vs. Machine)
Special Metamod:Source plugins by Old and Slow

* Bots are set to provide a challenge to the human players
* Bot count, health, and difficulty are calculated by:
    * The number of human players
    * Length of human/bot win streaks
    * If bots cannot be added, their health will increase
    * If a bot is killed too many times, it is kicked and another (usually a higher level) bot replaces it
